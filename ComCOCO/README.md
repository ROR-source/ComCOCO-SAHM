# ComCOCO
We have uploaded partial data on GitHub for evaluation and testing, and the complete dataset will be released on google driver (under the double blind principle).

## Statistics

The ComCOCO dataset consists of 107,912 referring expressions for 34,615 objects in 23,951 image pairs. Experimentally, we split 20,324 image pairs for training, 1,843 for validation, and 1,784 for testing. Each image pair contains an image with descriptive expressions and the ground truth after elimination.
